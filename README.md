# Micro-Social-Platform-Fika
This is a micro-social-platform using the .net MVC Entity Framework

This project was made by Georgescu Elena and Gheorghe Cosmina during the Full-Stack development course, by Cezara Benegui. We built an app where you can post text messages, join groups, create a private or public profile, where you can receive or send friend requests. Posts, comments and groups can only be deleted by the user who created them and the admin. We have also implemented a search bar that finds profiles by name and redirects us to them. A user sees the posts of a group only if he is a member.
